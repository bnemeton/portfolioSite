# Personal Web Dev Portfolio site
A basic portfolio site for a web developer.


## Details
There is a nav bar at the top of the site with the name and links to the relevant sections. The bar scrolls with the viewport/has a fixed position so that navigation is easy wherever you are on the page.

The about me section is followed by a section with images and names of projects (placeholders at the moment), which link to deployed applications (or would, if I had any). After that is a contact info section.
